Good exercise but not so easy IMHO because of the time formatting.

Without skills in other languages, I would have struggled to find how to show hourly forecasts for the current day only.

Same to write what date the daily forecasts concern, for example: `time.strftime('%b %d, %l %p:', time.localtime(item['time'])` to output “Jun 08, 11 PM”.
