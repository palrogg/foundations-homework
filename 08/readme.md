What was problematic:

* in both data sets:

** I had to understand the documentation in german, then to translate the columns in english.

* Stations and frequency:

** Use regular expressions

** “A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.” -> df.loc

** df['automat_ktu'].apply(automat)

* Equipment for disabled people:

** This data set sounded much more interesting than it actually was.
