Very interesting homework!

I had troubles with the “instability” of the reddit homepage.

I'm wondering what could be the best workaround to deal with reddit’s countermeasures. Maybe the script could call itself with a 5 minutes delay: `os.system("sleep 300; python3 Scraper.py;")` (See the workaround.py test script)
