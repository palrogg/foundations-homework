Tough and interesting exercise.

What took me the most time was to add precautions when dealing with bad data. At first, I didn't figure out that the Violation Time column could contain such rows as “042*A” or “.633P”.

I loved the “color replacement” part: it was interesting to think of an easy/elegant and optimized way to do this.

Deciding how to deal with partial data about prices (e.g. `vary` instead of a price) was an interesting challenge.

The funniest part was the graphics.
