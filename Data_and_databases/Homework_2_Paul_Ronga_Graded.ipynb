    "# Homework 2: Working with SQL (Data and Databases 2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework assignment takes the form of an IPython Notebook. There are a number of exercises below, with notebook cells that need to be completed in order to meet particular criteria. Your job is to fill in the cells as appropriate.\n",
    "You'll need to download this notebook file to your computer before you can complete the assignment. To do so, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you're viewing this notebook in Github.\n",
    "2. Ctrl+click (or right click) on the \"Raw\" button in the Github interface, and select \"Save Link As...\" or your browser's equivalent. Save the file in a convenient location on your own computer.\n",
    "3. Rename the notebook file to include your own name somewhere in the filename (e.g., Homework_2_Allison_Parrish.ipynb).\n",
    "4. Open the notebook on your computer using your locally installed version of IPython Notebook.\n",
    "5. When you've completed the notebook to your satisfaction, e-mail the completed file to the address of the teaching assistant (as discussed in class).\n",
